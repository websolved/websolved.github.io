    BEFORE YOU START, DOWNLOAD BOOTSTRAP FROM http://getbootstrap.com/getting-started/
    AND ADD THAT FOLDER TO YOUR PROJECT DIRECTORY. I usually prefer to keep assets like
    this in a separate folder called "vendor". This helps remind me that the files within
    shouldn't be manipulated directly, but are just there for me to use as-is.

      2)  Include the provided stylesheet (bootstrap.css or bootstrap.min.css). There
          is no requirement to also include the bootstrap-theme stylesheet that comes
          with the bootstrap distribution â€“ it is provided as an alternate look and
          feel to the standard theme.

      3)  Custom styles (if any) must always come AFTER bootstrap is included. Adding
          custom styles, however, is entirely optional. For prototyping, it's often 
          much better to skip writing your own styles altogether and just use what 
          bootstrap has to offer, however limiting it may feel at first.

      4)  At the *very* bottom of your document, first include jQuery. The Bootstrap
          javascript depends on it. It will not work if this order is reversed.

    <script src="http://code.jquery.com/jquery-1.11.3.min.js"></script>

    <!--
      5) Lastly, include the bootstrap javascript file.
